XJS syntax highlighting for VS Code

XJS is a template language that allows to mix pseudo XML elements within JavaScript or TypeScript functions (aka. **XJS templates**).
The main difference between XJS and JSX is that **XJS generates JavaScript statements** whereas **JSX generates expressions**.
As a consequence XJS code can be easily mixed with control statements (e.g. if blocks or loops).
Other key features of XJS include
- support of template **functions** and template **components**
- explicit declaration of **text nodes** that allow for precise white space control and easy interaction with JS statements
- support of (explicit) **decorators** (aka. directives in the angular world)
- **one-time binding** expressions
- clear **property / attribute** distinction
- advanced component attribute system (including **node attributes / data nodes**)

Code samples can be found in the test folder (of course they will display better with this extension activated!)
